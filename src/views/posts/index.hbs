                                Narcissa Malfoy. The son of a Death Eater, Draco was raised to strongly believe in the
                                importance of blood purity. He looked down on half-bloods and Muggle-borns. Draco
                                attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was sorted into Slytherin House
                                the moment the Sorting Hat touched his head.</p>
